                                Information. Personal Information means any information that may be used to identify an
                                individual, including, but not limited to, a first and last name, a home or other
                                physical address and an email address or other contact information, whether at work or

                                revealing any Personal Information about yourself. We strive to comply with all

                                principles set forth in this Privacy Policy even if, in connection with the above, we
                                transfer your Personal Information from your country to countries that may not require
                                an “adequate” level of protection for your Personal Information. In other words, our
                                goal is to provide protection for your Personal Information no matter where that
                                Personal Information is collected, transferred, or retained.</p>

                                address, and phone number) and financial information (such as credit card number,
